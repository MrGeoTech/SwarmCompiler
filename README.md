# SwarmCompiler
### What is it?
SwarmCompiler is a compiler for the Lyion programming language. It is for compiling code to run on a Swarm CPU. It is currently in development and is not yet ready for use.

## Plans for this project
- Implement the RISC-V ISA along with the necessary instructions for task management
- Create an implementation of the Swarm CPU in Turing Complete for visualization and testing purposes
- Create a compiler for the Lyion programming language that compiles to the ISA with task optimizations
- Create a physical implementation of the Swarm CPU using an FPGA using the Turning Complete implementation as a reference
- Look for and implement optimizations for the Swarm CPU and the compiler

## Plans for research with this project
- Implement an on-the-fly hardware transpiler for single threaded applications to run on all SWARM cores.
- GOALS: Run Linux on an FPGA with the transpiler and effectively run single-threaded applications on multiple threads
